# swiftwasm-linux-builder

Docker image with a SwiftWasm build published as 
[swiftwasm/swiftwasm-builder](https://hub.docker.com/r/swiftwasm/swiftwasm-builder).

This image contains the whole stack with source code checked out, compiled and packaged, 
and can be used for experimentation and testing. 

Please note that the image is huge and its compressed size is currently about 8GB. 
Still, in a lot of cases downloading it can still be faster that checking out and 
recompiling everything from scratch.
